    <h3 class="edudes">i attended creighton preperatory school and through my abilities in the football field
      and  the class room i was able to attend the university of north dakota. i chose computer
      because i always liked solving puzzles and after i got the hang of python i was in love.
      besides computer science skills i also learned how to leaverage my time being involved in football
      which was a very demandign extracurricular and a demanding major tiem manangment was a skill i learned early.
      My time at UND also gave me a team first mentality and hunger to work for my desired results.
